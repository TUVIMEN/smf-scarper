Things like rules of thumb, helpful hints for dealing with situations, ways to do the job just a little easier with perhaps a touch of professionalism tossed in for good measure.<br>For instance, I have found that when setting up rad barrier rope that may be expanded or shrunk repeatedly for storage of RAM, a knot called the tauntline knot is invaluable. &nbsp;This knot will stay where you place it and yet can be slipped along the rope run easily to shorten or lenghten the distance of a boundary. &nbsp;",
